My name is Artur Petrzak, and I am a mechatronics engineer.
In 2019, I graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology with a specialization in Multimedia Techniques at the Faculty of Mechatronics.

Studies satisfied my curiosity and need for understanding topics related to electronics, microcontrollers, sound & image processing, and programming.
This last field has always been my passion, so after completing my studies, I decided to further develop myself in this direction.

Currently, I'm working as a Java Developer, who is doing front-end from time to time.
I always strive to organize my work in a way that allows me to be as productive as possible.
I have a strong need to develop my skills and learn new things ‚Äî I like to move forward.
