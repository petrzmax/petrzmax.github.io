### Social Media

I'm running a YouTube channel since 2017, which gained over 66,000 subscribers and 14,000,000 views so far.
I also manage an associated Facebook profile - [ArtekDiy](https://www.facebook.com/ArtekDiy/) and a group - [Majstry Artka](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MajstryArtka/).

### Online courses and tutorials

I've created many technical tutorials for YouTube, and collaborated on several commercial online courses with Piotr Cichalewski from the [techtutor.pl](https://techtutor.pl) portal.
