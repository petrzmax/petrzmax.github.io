My name is Artur Petrzak, and I am a mechatronics engineer.
I graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology with a specialization in Multimedia Techniques at the Faculty of Mechatronics.

Studies satisfied my curiosity and need for understanding topics related to electronics, microcontrollers, sound & image processing, and programming.
This last field has always been my passion, so after completing my studies, I decided to further develop myself in this direction.

### My key values

- Honesty

### Tech stack

- Java 21
- Maven

### Tools

- Jira, Xray, Miro

## Other hobby interests and achievements

### Social Media

I'm running a YouTube channel since 2017, which gained over 66,000 subscribers and 14,000,000 views so far.
I also manage an associated Facebook profile - [ArtekDiy](https://www.facebook.com/ArtekDiy/) and a group - [Majstry Artka](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MajstryArtka/).

### Online courses and tutorials

I've created many technical tutorials for YouTube, and collaborated on several commercial online courses with **Piotr Cichalewski** from the [techtutor.pl](https://techtutor.pl) portal.

### Direct collaboration with numerous international brands

Creation of 3D Printers and other electronic devices reviews, negotiation of deals conditions, identifying and reaching out to companies that might be interested in collaboration.

The most recognizable brands I worked with:

- Anycubic, Creality, RatRig, Tevo, Gearbest, Banggood
