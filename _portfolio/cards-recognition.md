The program was developed as part of a Digital Image Processing course project (CPO - Cyfrowe przetwarzanie obrazu). Its objective was to create a program capable of recognizing cards in an image. It should identify the cards, count them, recognize their type and value. After this step, the program calculates the arithmetic mean of the recognized even cards. The algorithm is resistant to image disturbances, uneven lighting, and blurry images.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/petrzmax/CPO).
