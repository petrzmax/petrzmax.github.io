## This project is **Work in Progress**! Hit me on **GitHub** if you want to contribute

### Tech stack: Java, Spring, React

Web application inspired by **csgodouble**, which back in the days allowed Counter-Strike: Global Offensive players, to exchange their skins for credits, and bet them on roulette results.
There were many conspiracy theories regarding controlling the roulette results by the owners, or modulating them in the night hours to make bots created by players fail.

Usage of this kind of bots were of course prohibited!

I wanted to create a safe space for developers interested in creating bots, scripting and gambling.
There is no monetary value involved here, so there is no reason for modulating results - it will allow verifying these theories!

The main purpose of this project is combining curiosity, fun, coding, and JS education.

It's also my space to test ideas, which later on I can effectively introduce at work.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/petrzmax/dev-roulette).
