A classic computer game built using **C++ Builder 6 as one of the educational windowed applications which I have created.
It was a game developed as part of a programming course I attended.
It was an interesting experience because the programming environment was outdated and not meant for game development but rather for windowed applications.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/petrzmax/PingPong).
