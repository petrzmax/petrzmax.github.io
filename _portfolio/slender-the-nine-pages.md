Slender: The Nine Pages was my first serious production on Unity Engine, as well as first serious IT project at all.
I was **17** when I started working on this game, having no prior experience with game development, 3D modeling, or level design.
Throughout the process, I learned a lot about creating computer games.
I was a beginner programmer back then, so the code isn't something worth showcasing.
However, I'm still proud of the algorithm controlling the Slender (the antagonist).
In 2020, I decided to update and refresh the project's graphics slightly.

The scripts were written in C#, and the 3D models were created using Blender.

The game is available to download [here](https://www.indiedb.com/games/slender-the-nine-pages).

Gameplay by YouTuber **Markiplier**. So far it has received over **3 million** views!
