A game developed as part of the Computer Graphics (GRK) course project.
The project's goal was to create a game that would creatively utilize Bézier Curves.
The player's task is to guess the number of control points of the currently displayed curve.
The game also features a simulation option, which is excellent for demonstrating these types of curves.
The project was created in **Processing** (Processing is based on the Java language, although it allows for creating projects in JavaScript and Python.).

The game is available to download [here](http://bit.ly/2j9eEWg).
