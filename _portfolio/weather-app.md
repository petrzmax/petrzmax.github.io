A window program created in **Java** using **JavaFx**. The application uses the **IpStack** API to retrieve the user's current location based on their IP address, and then uses the **AccuWeather** API to display the weather forecast for the next 5 days.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/petrzmax/WeatherApp).
