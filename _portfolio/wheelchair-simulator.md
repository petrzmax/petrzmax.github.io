Project developed as a part of my engineering thesis.

Thesis title: Development of a multimedia application showing the world from the perspective of a wheelchair user.

The game was built on the Unity engine and aimed to provide an observation of the world from the perspective of a disabled person.
As a result it should help healthy people to understand the problems of people moving in a wheelchair, especially around the city. 

Scripts were written in C#.

Information about the game was featured on **Radio Eska** and **TVP3 Warsaw**.

The game is available to download [here](https://www.indiedb.com/games/wheelchair-simulator).

A video showcasing my engineering thesis and the stories associated with it.
